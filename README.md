# Land-Registry-using-Ethereum-blockchain-and-machine-learning
This repository contains the implementation of a decentralized land registry system leveraging the power of blockchain technology and machine learning. The project aims to create a transparent, secure, and efficient system for managing and verifying land ownership and transactions.

Key Features:

Blockchain-Based Land Registry: Ensures immutable and tamper-proof records of land ownership, transactions, and land-related documents using a distributed ledger.

Smart Contracts: Automates the verification and transfer of ownership, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing trust between parties.

Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes machine learning algorithms for property valuation, fraud detection, and predicting market trends to support decision-making.

Decentralization and Security: Protects data integrity and user privacy through a decentralized architecture, eliminating single points of failure and minimizing the risk of data breaches.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to manage and track land records, initiate transactions, and access analytics.

Technologies Used:

Blockchain: Ethereum, Hyperledger, or any other blockchain platform.

Smart Contracts: Solidity .

Machine Learning: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn.

Frontend: React.js.

Backend: Node.js.
